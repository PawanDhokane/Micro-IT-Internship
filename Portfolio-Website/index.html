      <p>Welcome to My Portfolio! 🚀
        Hello, and thank you for visiting my online portfolio! I'm Pawan Dhokane, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong foundation in creating responsive, user-friendly, and dynamic websites.

        <p>🌐 What I Do:
        I specialize in front-end development using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Vue.js. My goal is to transform creative ideas into fully functional, aesthetically pleasing websites that provide an exceptional user experience. I also have hands-on experience with back-end development, databases, and APIs, which allows me to build full-stack applications when needed.</p>
        
        
        <p>💡 Why I Love Web Development:
        The ever-evolving nature of web technologies keeps me motivated. I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new tools, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on the web. Whether it’s building a sleek user interface, optimizing performance, or debugging tricky code, I approach every challenge with enthusiasm and a problem-solving mindset.</p>
        
        <p>🚀 My Approach:
        I believe that great web development is more than just writing code—it’s about understanding the user, designing intuitive interfaces, and delivering robust, scalable solutions. My process involves thorough planning, clean code architecture, and continuous learning to stay ahead in this fast-paced industry.</p>
